The use of differential_ifk_node.cpp is deprecated until it has been rewritten
as a library.

The functionality of "Forward" and "Inverse" are interchanged and the use of
parameters is not according to current FroboMind standards.

It is recommended to use the Python library for now , alternatively writing a
differential_ifk.cpp library based on the Python library).
